# detect-diabetic-retinopathy-

 
Problem Statement:
 You are a Computer Vision Engineer at health.ai. Your company is developing a deep learning application to automate the detection of diabetic retinopathy. The company is collecting high-resolution retina image data from various clinical partners. However, the dataset is expected to be enormous and cannot be stored on a central system. You have been assigned the task of building a proof of concept using the Kaggle retinopathy dataset. Your goal is to train a CNN model with the Mirrored Strategy and deploy it with TensorFlow Serving.
